      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <p>
        F. Scott Fitzgerald's <em>The Great Gatsby</em> is a classic American novel published in 1925. It explores themes such as the American Dream, wealth, love, and social change during the Jazz Age. Narrated by Nick Carraway, the story revolves around the mysterious and wealthy Jay Gatsby and his tragic love for Daisy Buchanan. Celebrated for its lyrical prose and vivid imagery, the novel offers a sharp critique of American society in the 1920s.

        <h5>Wealth and Class  </h5>
        <p>The novel explores the disparity between the wealthy elite and the working class, highlighting the corrupting influence of wealth. </p>
         <div class="character-card">
        <h5>The American Dream </h5>
        <p>Then, as now,  many Americans believed that “anyone, regardless of where they were born or what class they were born into, [could] attain their own version of success in a society where upward mobility is possible for everyone” </p>
         <div class="character-card">
        <h5>Obsession with the Past and Future  </h5>
        <p>Gatsby is the clearest example of a character stuck in the past due to his obsession with Daisy. Nick observes him “stretch[ing] out his arms toward the dark water” (Fitzgerald 21). The reader soon learns that Gatsby is continuously reaching for a green light at the end of the Buchanans’ dock, signifying his continual pursuit of Daisy. </p>

        <h5>Dysfunctional Relationships </h5>
        <p>Fitzgerald’s novel is littered with questionable characters and suspicious situations. Characters constantly act and speak behind each other’s back, making it difficult to trust or predict anyone’s motives in the novel. Tom and Daisy’s relationship is the most obvious example of secrecy </p>

      <h7>New York City and on Long Island</h7>
      <p> The action of The Great Gatsby takes place along a corridor stretching from New York City to the suburbs known as West and East Egg. West and East Egg serve as stand-ins for the real-life locations of two peninsulas along the northern shore of Long Island. Midway between the Eggs and Manhattan lies the “valley of ashes,” where Myrtle and George Wilson have a run-down garage. This corridor between New York and the suburbs encompasses the full range of social class. Whereas the valley of ashes is a place of evident poverty, both the city and the two suburbs represent bastions of affluence. Nick describes the profound optimism he feels when arriving in the city by train: “The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.” He goes on to assert, “Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge.” Yet for all that New York appears full of possibility, Nick often finds his actual experience there sad, as when, in Chapter 3, he observes “young clerks . . . wasting the most poignant moments of the night and life.”</p> </div>

      <div class="character-grid">
      <div class="character-card">
      <h7> 1922 </h7>
      <p> Fitzgerald explores the major developments of the Roaring Twenties, including the birth of jazz, the women’s suffrage movement, economic prosperity, and the rapid growth of Manhattan as a cosmopolitan center. He mentions the many new technologies beginning to be popularized at the time such as automobiles, radio, movies, as well as the growing influence of the financial markets in New York. Several characters (including Gatsby and Nick) served in the war, an unstable period that established the country as a global economic leader, and the characters’ unstinting embrace of luxury echo the country’s rampant appetite for consumer goods during the period. </p>
